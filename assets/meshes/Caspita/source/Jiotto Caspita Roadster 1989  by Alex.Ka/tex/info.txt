Jiotto Caspita Roadster 1989  by Alex.Ka.

Since this car is very rare and was made in a limited number, the manufacturer did not have the opportunity to develop this car in other body styles.
So it became interesting for me to make a roadster version for this car.
I don't have a lot of skill in 3D, but I tried to do everything I can to achieve that goal.
I share the results with you in the hope that this model will be useful to someone and will now exist in the 3D world.
